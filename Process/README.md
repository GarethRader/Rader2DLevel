Design Goals:

- create emotions of frustration and accomplishment with player progress
        - similar to jump king
        - jumping puzzles require precision and timing to get through which can be difficult at times
        - can "lose" progress if incorrect jump is made and the player has to go through parts they have already done....

I also designed the level with iterations/variations in mind starting from simple jumping puzzles and doing harder variations on them. I am hoping to find the balance of difficult and not too easy which I think is a challenge for many jumping puzzle games.
